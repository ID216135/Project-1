# Project-1

This project is for the EdEx Data Visualization Bootcamp affiliated with Case Western Reserve University. There were three group members working on this project: Ian Denker, Jonathan Bateson, and Maddie Haughton. The purpose of the project was to analyze a real world data set and visualize trends. 

Our group chose to consider trends in the telemedicine usage in the United States since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March of 2020. We analyzed Medicare Telehealth Trends from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This data is found in the csv file "Medicare_Telehealth_Trends_Q1_2023.csv" in the Data folder in this repository. We downloaded this file from https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-use-and-payments/medicare-service-type-reports/medicare-telehealth-trends.

We worked collectively to clean the original dataset by reading the csv file, creating a dataframe, removing rows of empty data, and separating the data into datasets based on if it was aggregated at the national level or by individual state. Each group member then visualized the data to answer different analysis questions that we came up together at the start of our project. This analysis and visualization was done in the three seperate ipynb files named "Medicare_Analysis_MH.ipynb", "Medicare_Analysis_States&Locality.ipynb", and Medicare_analysis_demo.ipynb".
